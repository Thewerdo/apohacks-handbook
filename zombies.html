                Regular old zombie. Avoid bites and scratches. Motivations seem to be to consume brains. Low intelligence. Slow. Some have been spotted wearing floaties, allowing them to float on water. Leading theory as to where they were obtained is Lake Ontario.

                Similar to the regular zombie. Uses a flag to signify that a large horde of zombies is approaching. Moves slightly faster than normal zombies.

                Regular zombie that has decided to put a traffic cone on. Traffic cone absorbs a good amount of damage. Be wary.

                Regular zombie that has decided to put a bucket on its head. The bucket seems to have a streak of blood on it. The bucket absorbs a large amount of damage. Magnets seem to be effective in taking the bucket off.

            </td>
            <td>
                Capable of jumping over most plants. Runs pretty fast before jumping. Tall-nut blocks this. Was likely a pole vaulter before becoming zombified. Evidently wasn't that good, since Tall-Nuts aren't that tall.

            <td>
                Seems to have been reading the newspaper before being zombified. Appears to rely on newspaper to function. Newspaper blocks shots from Peashooters. When newspaper is broken, zombie becomes enraged and speeds up.

            </td>
            <td>
                Regular zombie that picked up a screen door to act as a shield. Screen door is thwarted by catapult plants. Magnets have also been effective in taking it away. Still absorbs a large amount of damage.

            </td>
            <td>
                Was likely a football player before being zombified. Equipment absorbs a huge amount of damage. Highly recommended to either use a Potato Mine to blow it up or a magnet to get rid of its armour. Quite speedy as well. Leading theory is that they were bitten on the forearm, since that is the only bit of exposed skin.

            <td>
                Zamboni probably stolen from Scotiabank Arena. Zamboni seems to immediately crumble when rolling over spikes of any kind. Other than that, it is extremely tough, and leaves an ice trail behind wherever it goes.

                Zombie that is floating due to a balloon. Wind Clover can blow it away. If you don't have Wind Clover, use a sharp throwable object, such as a spear or stick, to try and pop the balloon.

                Carpenter zombie that carries aroudn a ladder to climb over specifically defensive plants. Magnets can take this ladder away. Otherwise, it also absorbs a good amount of damage, but can be evaded through catapult plants.

            <td>
                Zombie that hides near the back of the horde and throws catapulted basketballs. Can be mitigated by having a roof. Note that this may impede catapult plants.

            <td>
                Gigantic zombie with a massive amount of health. Once half its health is done,  it will throw a small midget zombie very far. Will instantly crush all plants within reach. If you see this, either focus everything onto it or run. Explosives are effective against this monster.
