                <td>
                    Most common plant encountered, and first plant discovered to help fight against zombies. Shoots deadly peas straight forward. Solid attack, can hold off a few zombies on its own. Needs help clearing tougher zombies and hordes. Has many variants, most of which are included.

                <td>
                    Also very common. Very similar to Peashooter, but has double the firing rate. However, it takes up 2x the maintenance. An advantage could be taking up less space than 2 Peashooters.

                <td>
                    Another common variant of Peashooter. Fires ice cold peas, but requires more maintenance than base Peashooter. Zombies in Toronto seem to be less affected by ice than those observed in other regions, possibly due to Canada's colder climate.

                <td>
                    Less common variant of Peashooter. Has three heads that act independently, allowing each head to fire a pea at the same rate as a regular Peashooter. Requires over 3x the maintenance of regular Peashooter, yet takes up 1/3 of the space of 3 Peashooters.

                    Lobs kernels and butter in air. Butter has unknown properties that causes zombies to temporarily halt in place. Same maintenance as Peashooter. Damage output is slightly lower, but stun may be worth it. It is unknown why the Corn-Pult lobs butter in tandem with corn kernels. Leading theory suspects popcorn.

                    Solid defensive plant, able to hold back zombies for a long period of time. Often used as a blockade to halt zombies at a location, giving time and space for people to think and act. Appears to be in distress as the zombies chip away at it. Could be worth investigating.

It is unclear where the perpetual fire comes from. Pumpkins work great in tandem with these, as these have to be near the front lines.
